# Chatbot using OpenAI APIs

## Introduction

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of a chatbot that utilizes OpenAI APIs for generating text-based responses. The chatbot incorporates several special commands that make use of specific tags, thereby enabling users to interact with it more efficiently and in a more intuitive manner. 

## Features

- Commands: The bot supports numerous commands using special tags like `{TIME}` and `{DATE}`. These tags correspond to time and date functionality, respectively.
- Error Logging: An `error.txt` file is automatically generated for logging any errors that may occur during the chatbot's operation. 

## Command Classes

The chatbot utilizes a set of command classes such as `TimeCommand` and `DateCommand` that extend from a `BaseCommand` class. Each command class incorporates a `check_tag` method, which is capable of recognizing the relevant tags within the user's input. The functionality encapsulated in the `execute` method is then used to replace the tag in the user's input with the appropriate response.

## Chatbot Class

The `Chatbot` class is the main class responsible for managing and executing the commands within user input. The `execute_commands_in_response` method identifies and executes the relevant command based on the user's input, replacing the tag with the appropriate response. The `chat` method is used to initiate the chatbot.

## Usage

You can initiate the chatbot using the `chat` method of the `Chatbot` class. This will allow the chatbot to start accepting and responding to user input.

```python
from chatbot import Chatbot

# Create a chatbot instance
bot = Chatbot()

# Initiate the chat
bot.chat()
```

Please note that specific commands can be issued using their respective tags. For instance, to get the current date, you would use the `{DATE}` tag.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7 or higher
- An active OpenAI account with API access
